			<h2>Theory Of Change </h2>
      <p class="P"><b> “We provide knowledge and skills about RTE to parents of public (government) school going children. 
        Parents have a problem that their children are not learning. We solve this problem by informing and equipping SMC 
        parent members with the knowledge and skills required to perform their duties as envisioned in Section 21 of RTE.</b></p>

      <p class="P"><b>We’re unique because we foster parent leaders {resource person(s) who knows RTE, government systems in and out} from within a community to make community led implementation of RTE a reality.”

        a) Our intervention fosters parent leaders
        b) Parent leaders inform the community about the status of the schools continuously.
        c) Communities come together to ensure public schools function as per government mandated norms and standards.
        d) Public Schools become equitable centers of excellence.</b></p>
